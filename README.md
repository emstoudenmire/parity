# Generative Modeling Even-Parity Dataset with MPS

Experiments with the even-parity bitstring data set,
and learning this data (generative modeling) using matrix product state (MPS)
tensor networks, also known as tensor trains (TT)

The algorithm and goal of this project is described in the companion paper
